# train_scheduler

This is a train scheduler app that is linked to a firebase database that will keep track of all the data.

Time will update thanks to firebase.

You can add a train, destination, first train time, and frequency of when the train leaves the station.

All this data will be input into firebase and with the use of moment.js it will produce the next arrival time and how many minutes away the train is.
